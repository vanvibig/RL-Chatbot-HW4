i counted on you to help my cause you and that thug are obviously failing arent we ever going on our date
you got something on your mind
where
there
well theres someone i think might be --
how is our little find the wench a date plan progressing

i dont want to know how to say that though i want to know useful things like where the good stores are how much does champagne cost stuff like chat i have never in my life had to point out my head to someone
right see youre ready for the quiz
cesc ma tete this is my head
let me see what i can do
gosh if only we could find kat a boyfriend
thats a shame
unsolved mystery she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
why
seems like she could get a date easy enough
the thing is cameron -- im at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser my sister i cant date until she does
cameron
no no its my fault -- we didnt have a proper introduction ---
forget it
youre asking me out thats so cute whats your name again
okay then how bout we try out some french cuisine saturday night

i did
you think you  re the only sophomore at the prom
i dont have to be home til two
i have to be home in twenty minutes
all i know is -- id give up my private line to go out with a guy like joey
sometimes i wonder if the guys were supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with you know
bianca i dont think the highlights of dating joey dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding
combination i dont know -- i thought hed be different more of a gentleman
is he oily or dry
he practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist i mean dr bonchowski is great an all but hes not exactly relevant party conversation
would you mind getting me a drink cameron
great
joey
who
where did he go he was just here
you might wanna think about it
no
did you change your hair
you know the deal i can  t go if kat doesnt go --
listen i want to talk to you about the prom
youre concentrating awfully hard considering its gym class
hi joey
hey sweet cheeks
my agent says ive got a good shot at being the prada guy next year

i just wanted --
you set me up
let go
so did you
you looked beautiful last night you know
i guess ill never know will i
not all experiences are good bianca you cant always trust the people you want to
god youre just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i cant experience anything for myself
i guess i thought i was protecting you
im not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
thats not
no you didnt if you really thought i could make my own decisions you wouldve let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
why didnt you tell me
after that i swore id never do anything just because everyone else was doing it and i havent since except for bogeys party and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
but
just once afterwards i told him i didnt want to anymore i wasnt ready he got pissed then he broke up with me
you did what
he said everyone was doing it so i did it
as in
now i do back then was a different story
but you hate joey
he was like a total babe
why
in th for a month
what
joey never told you we went out did he
i wish i had that luxury im the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i cant go because you won  t
i do care but im a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else  s 
like you care
listen i know you hate having to sit home because im not susie high school
youre welcome
i dont get you you act like youre too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
i really dont think i need any social advice from you right now
bianca i need to talk to you -- i need to tell you --
can we go now
you are so completely unbalanced
yeah hes your freak friend mandellas boyfriend i guess since im not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too
its shakespeare maybe youve heard of him
like im supposed to know what that even means
at least im not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig
cant you forget for just one night that youre completely wretched
bogey lowensteins party is normal but youre too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that
whats normal
youre ruining my life because you wont be normal i cant be normal
i think youre a freak i think you do this to torture me and i think you suck
what do you think
oh i thought you might have a date i dont know why im bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowensteins party saturday night
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and were going
oh my god does this mean youre becoming normal
can you at least start wearing a bra
i have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you dont get out of my way
nowhere hi daddy
whereve you been
i have a date daddy and he  s not a captain of oppression like some men we know
im missing something
fine i see that im a prisoner in my own house im not a daughter im a possession
youre not going unless your sister goes end of story
hes not a hot rod whatever that is
its that hot rod joey right that  s who you want me to bend my rules for
no but
the prom kat has a date
daddy i want to discuss the prom with you its tomorrow night --
because shell scare them away
why
promise me you wont talk to any boys unless your sister is present
just for a minute
daddy no
wear the belly before you go
its just a party daddy
oh god its starting
if kats not going youre not going
daddy people expect me to be there
its just a party daddy but i knew youd forbid me to go since gloria steinem over there isnt going --
otherwise known as an orgy
if you must know we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends
and wherere you going
daddy i --
exactly my point
but she doesnt want to date
but its not fair -- shes a mutant daddy
then neither will you and ill get to sleep at night
what if she never starts dating
no youre not dating until your sister starts dating end of discussion
now dont get upset daddy but theres this boy and i think he might ask
just sent em through
padua girls one tall decent body the other one kinda short and undersexed
never
fan of a fan you see a couple of minors come in
didnt have you pegged for a gigglepuss fan arent they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you
always a pleasure brucie
best case scenario youre back on the payroll for awhile
you humiliated the woman sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score
no i  m not
buttholus extremus but hey youre making progress
the hell is that what kind of guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while youre talking to her
extremely unfortunate maneuver
hell ive just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
you told me that part already
its her favorite band
assail your ears for one night
okay i wasnt sure
hes pretty
dead at forty-one
her favorite uncle
its a lung cancer issue
number one she hates smokers
are you kidding hell piss himself with joy hes the ultimate kiss ass
will bogey get bent
in that case well need to make it a school-wide blow out
this is it a golden opportunity patrick can ask katarina to the party
like we had a choice besides -- when you let the enemy think hes orchestrating the battle youre in a position of power we let him pretend hes calling the shots and while hes busy setting up the plan you have time to woo bianca
you got him involved
hey -- ive gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street
i thought you hated those people
you know if you do go out with bianca youd be set youd outrank everyone strictly a-list with me by your side
thats what i just said
did she actually say shed go out with you
forget his reputation do you think weve got a plan or not
im serious man hes whacked he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers
they always let felons sit in on honors biology
no kidding hes a criminal i heard he lit a state trooper on fire he just got out of alcatraz
he seems like he thrives on danger
what makes you think hell do it
you wanna go out with him
what about him
unlikely but even so she still cant go out with you so whats the point
i teach her french get to know her dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me
the mewling rampalian wretch herself
thats her biancas sister
yeah just a minor encounter with the shrew
you could consecrate with her my friend
you mean id get a chance to talk to her
guess who just signed up for a tutor
sure do  my moms from canada
you know french
joey dorsey perma-shit-grin i wish i could say hes a moron but hes number twelve in the class and a model mostly regional stuff but hes rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out
he always have that shit-eating grin
because theyre bred to their mothers liked guys like that and their grandmothers before them their gene pool is rarely diluted
why do girls like that always like guys like that
i could start with your haircut but it doesnt matter shes not allowed to date until her older sister does and thats an impossibility
why not
bianca stratford sophomore dont even think about it
who is she
you burn you pine you perish
that girl -- i --
yeah but these guys have never seen a horse they just jack off to clint eastwood
that im used to
couple thousand most of them evil
how many people go here
get out
thirty-two
how many people were in your old school
yeah a couple were outnumbered by the cows though
i was kidding people actually live there
north actually howd you 
so -- which dakota you from
cmon im supposed to give you the tour
so they tell me
you the new guy
you get the girl
whats the worst
where
she kissed me
you makin any headway
she just needs time to cool off ill give it a day
she hates you with the fire of a thousand suns  thats a direct quote
i don  t know i decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it
whatd you do to her
then go get her
sure
cameron -- do you like the girl
shes partial to joey not me
what re you talking about
its off the whole thing
cameron im a little busy
dont make me do it man
gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night
so what does that give me im supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who cant play their instruments
okay -- likes thai food feminist prose and angry stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion
ive retrieved certain pieces of information on miss katarina stratford i think youll find helpful
whatve you got for me
yeah -- well see
and he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way
and why would i do that
leave my sister alone
your sister here
away
where ya goin
not at all
hey -- do you mind
theyre running the rest of me next month
yeah and i noticed the only part of you featured in your big kmart spread was your elbow tough break
the vintage look is over kat havent you been reading your sassy
enough with the barbie n ken shit i know
i dont know dorsey the limo -the flowers another hundred for the tux --
get her to act like a human
do what
howd you do it
a deals a deal
its about time
forget her sister then
forget it
a hundred bucks a date
what
i just upped my price
i got her under control she just acts crazed in public to keep up the image
watching the bitch trash my car doesnt count as a date
im on it
when i shell out fifty i expect results
fifty and youve got your man
take it or leave it this isnt a negotiation
fine thirty
i cant take a girl like that out on twenty bucks
how much
i cant date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend and thats the catch she doesnt want a boyfriend
youre gonna pay me to take out some girl
you got it verona i pick up the tab you do the honors
but youd go out with her if you had the cake
you need money to take a girl out
you just said
sure sparky ill get right on it
yeah whatever i want you to go out with her
two legs nice rack
what do you think
yeah
hey -- its all for the higher good right
you better not fuck this up im heavily invested
what we took bathes together when we were kids
you and verona
uh yeah were old friend
i hear youre helpin verona
so what you need to do is recruit a guy wholl go out with her someone whos up for the job
does this conversation have a purpose
but she cant go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her right
were not
well actually i thought id run an idea by you you know just to see if youre interested
we dont chat
nope - just came by to chat
are you lost
hey
oh honey -- tell me we havent progressed to full-on hallucinations
william - he asked me to meet him here
who
have you seen him
oh good something new and different for us
you  re looking at this from the wrong perspective were making a statement
okay okay we wont go its not like i have a dress anyway
listen to you you sound like betty all pissed off because archie is taking veronica
well i guess were not since we dont have dates 
can you even imagine who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess
i got drunk i puked i got rejected it was big fun
you didnt
i did bianca a favor and it backfired
you didnt have a choice wheres kat and what have you done with her
i didnt have a choice
you went to the party i thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity
who cares
whatd he say
no fear
you think thisll work
if i was bianca it would be any school you want precious dont forget your tiara
does it matter
i appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death but im consuming do you mind
neither has his heterosexuality
thats never been proven
william didnt even go to high school
william would never have gone to a state school
so he has this huge raging fit about sarah lawrence and insists that i go to his male-dominated puking frat boy number one golf team school i have no say at all
you could always go with me im sure william has some friends
the people at this school are so incredibly foul
but imagine the things hed say during sex
i realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking but killing yourself so you can be with william shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions youre venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy
an attempted slit
whats this
just a little
mandella eat starving yourself is a very slow way to die
block e
he always look so
im sure hes completely incapable of doing anything that interesting
thats pat verona the one who was gone for a year i heard he was doing porn movies
patrick verona random skid
whos that
don  t you even dare  
oh bianca can you get me my freshman yearbook
because i like to torture you
why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill
yeah but then i fucked up i fell for her
is that right
besides i had some extra cash some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl
i thought you could use it when you start your band
a fender strat you bought this
i didnt care about the money
really what was it like a down payment now then a bonus for sleeping with me
it wasnt like that
you were paid to take me out by -- the one person i truly hate i knew it was a set-up
wait i
it gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook
that  s completely adorable
thats where i was last year shed never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- i stayed with her i wasnt in jail i dont know marilyn manson and ive never slept with a spice girl i spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching wheel of fortune end of story
what
my grandmothers 
look im -- sorry -- that i questioned your motives i was wrong
oh huh
its just something i had you know
its scurvys his date got convicted whered you get the dress
howd you get a tux at the last minute
nothing theres nothing in it for me just the pleasure of your company
answer the question patrick
you need therapy has anyone ever told you that
you tell me
so i have to have a motive to be with you
create a little drama start a new rumor what
because i dont want to its a stupid tradition
why not
no i wont go with you
no what
no
you know what i mean
is that a request or a command
go to the prom with me
youre amazingly self-assured has anyone ever told you that
no one else knows
what
youre sweet and sexy and completely hot for me
no -- something real something no one else knows
i hate peas
tell me something true
i know the porn careers a lie
hearsay
the duck
fallacy
state trooper
for   
you up for it
you never disappointed me
how
then you screwed up
something like that
so if you disappoint them from the start youre covered
i dont like to do what people expect then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change
yes
acting the way we do
so whats your excuse
yeah well dont let it get out
a soft side who knew
i dazzled him with my wit
so howd you get chapin to look the other way
good call
i figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect and piss you off
the partridge family
maybe
you want me to climb up and show you how to get down
forget it im stayin
put your right foot there --
try lookin at it from this angle
cmon its not that bad
i guess i never told you im afraid of heights
look up sunshine
he left i sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me
other than my upchuck reflex nothing
so what did i have an effect on 
dont for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties
unwelcome i guess someone still has her panties in a twist
unwelcome
wholesome
pleasant
you re so --
i heard there was a poetry reading
what are you doing here
excuse me have you seen the feminine mystique i lost my copy

i hate him
dorsey

like you could find one
because then id have to start taking out girls who like me
why

you dont care if i die
i told you
why re you doing this
leave it to you to use big words when youre shitfaced
this is so patronizing
what if you have a concussion my dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable not that i could tell the difference

uh uh you lie down and youll go to sleep
i just need to lie down for awhile
youre not okay

you know who the raincoats are
you know these guys are no bikini kill or the raincoats but theyre right up there
do you mind youre sort of ruining it for me
thats what you want isnt it
excuse me

hey great show huh
depends on the topic my fenders dont really whip me into a verbal frenzy
youre not a big talker are you

my mission in life
theres a way to get a guys attention
sweating like a pig actually and yourself
i mean wo-man how ya doin
oh christ dont tell me youve changed your mind i already sent em a check
when i go
you know fathers dont like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives it means weve become spectators bianca still lets me play a few innings youve had me on the bleachers for years when you go to sarah lawrence i wont even be able to watch the game
no -- impressed
whats the matter upset that i rubbed off on her
bianca did what
the part where bianca beat the hell out of some guy
which parts
parts of it
so tell me about this dance was it fun
no daddy
i dont understand the allure of dehydrated food is this something i should be hip to

i want to go to an east coast school i want you to trust me to make my own choices i want --
youre eighteen you dont know what you want you wont know until youre forty-five and you dont have it
so what i want doesnt matter
as a parent thats my right
because youre making decisions for me
why cant we agree on this
i thought you were punishing me
is this about sarah lawrence you punishing me

my insurance does not cover pms

i thought we decided you were going to school here at u of 
i know

am i supposed to feel better like right now or do i have some time to think about it
no  i believe heinous bitch is the term used most often
tempestuous
the point is kat -- people perceive you as somewhat 
i still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls i was merely a spectator
well yes compared to your other choices of expression this year todays events are quite mild by the way bobby rictors gonad retrieval operation went quite well in case youre interested
expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action
katarina stratford my my youve been terrorizing ms blaise again

if-god-wills-it
asia can be found to the west -- and i will prove it
blind faith is what i consider heresy
dont you realize your words could be considered heretical
did he not choose a carpenters son to reveal himself to the world
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
no the portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people i too will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of god
is that all that interests you gold
trade your excellency according to marco polo the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold
if they agree to follow me yes
your life and that of others
your eminence there is only one way to settle the matter and that is to make the journey i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
excellency you are right
senor colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment
then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the earth is approximately  leagues or more which makes the ocean uncrossable
i am your eminence
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ are you familiar with the work of aristotle erathostene ptolemeus
yes your eminence the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
you say asia can be found by sailing west
a waste let me tell you something arojaz if your name or mine is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his
what a tragedy what a waste of a life
you can see for yourself
on the contrary your eminence it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
it wont be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez
indeed the world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them when it benefits them my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain
he is a mercenary did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions
naturally but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a dispute over a point of geography
the judgment is ours
the state has some reason to be interested in this mans proposition your eminence
i cant keep my eyes off you i would like to catch up with all the moments i didnt spend with you
what is it now tell me
i am busy inside
cant you stay with us a little
not everything do you think i care im a free man again riches dont make a man rich they only make him busier
they took everything
they tried but i didnt let them
god youre so beautiful i cant believe no other man has ever taken you away from me

you dont usually ask
beatrix i want to ask you something
thats something you cant decide
i dont want you to wait for me
im not asking you to swear to anything

the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras

thats what it says
god thats in a week
father i am doing what i think is the best for him and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself
diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious brothers should be raised together colon even brothers from different mothers
your majesty -- some men are content to read about things i must see them with my own eyes i cannot be other than i am
there is one thing id like to understand why do you want to go back after all this
thank you
but without your brothers nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies you may explore the continent
they come and go as naked as the day god created them
do they have such thoughts
thirty seven your majesty and you
how old are you senor colon
a woman
i know what i see i see someone who doesnt accept the world as it is whos not afraid i see a women who thinks what if
you show no inclination to speak otherwise
may i speak freely
surely you can do anything you want
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council
that she was impregnable
what did they say about granada before today
the ocean is uncrossable
no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors
i should not even be listening to you since my council said no but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity and sanchez that you are not a fool
you will regret this
youll be held in detention deprived of your privileges and possessions until you are returned to spain where you will be judged have you anything to say
savagery is what monkeys understand
in one act of brutality you have created chaos tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us all that because of your criminal savagery
you did not hear me don colon not my horse
don moxica -- we all have to work
my horse doesnt work
we cant raise the wheel without it
we came here to stay to build not to start a crusade in this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days so we will be brave and swallow our grief and in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for
we dont need to know
you want a war fine we are a thousand they outnumber us by ten who will you kill which tribe
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders youll do as i say
we lost cousins friends we will wash this in blood
the indians have no such word don moxica

because he is not afraid of me
then why
i know i should not tolerate his impertinence
and who would you think of for such a task
he must be replaced
then what do you suggest don sanchez

 but there is worse he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
we werent expecting immediate profits were we we must have faith we must give time for time
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying but with no gold the new world proves expensive your majesty

never your majesty although
you were right don sanchez his demands could never be granted

well this is gonna end your career and probably mine
chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian
forgot you handcuffed a civilian to a tree
what was i supposed to do the guy tried to mug me i was gonna send a cop back - i just forgot
the public doesnt have any idea what we do and now youre going to define our image this is going to be our rodney king

chief - mind if i take her
oh really thats nice you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot are you out of your fucking mind are you having that much trouble gettin dates
no nothing happened
a shower did you take one too
i let her take a shower

i came to see how the investigation was going i called and youre not here i wait up at the station and you dont even show up i beep you - you dont return my call where the hell have you been

oh my g-d honey honeys dead
we dont have her i d yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel
whats wrong
homicide miss hearn its detective eddie flemming open up
i have nothin to say if you wanna contact my attorney
police wed like to ask you a few questions
whos there
you know i dont know i like you you remind me of a puppy i used to have he pissed on the rug all the time but i still kept him
whyd you help me back there with the chief whyd you stand up for me like that
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer here heres a number of an immigration lawyer thats how you help her but you cant get involved in her like that youre gonna jeopardize your career your life and youre gonna jeopardize my case and lemme give you another piece of advice maybe you dont watch tv but ill let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin world watches television and when you get out there they know your face and the little fame the little fuckin itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job and i get more done because of it
but i mean didnt you ever go out on a limb for somebody i mean you shoulda heard her there tellin her whole story i believed her
well its not up to you to decide whether shes innocent or not dont you understand thats why youre a professional
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think shes innocent
no i dont think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it i mean to say the least you outta know better you dont know her well enough shes got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her its fuckin over you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference youre dead
yeah just her in the shower nothing happened look im sure you probably think im a fool and i fucked up but
just a shower
i took her there for a shower and thats it
well you shoulda because nobodys gonna believe you didnt including me
look eddie im tellin you - i didnt touch her
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
hey im a professional
okay tell you what ill give you a head start you take her to the station house dont let her out of your sight shes the only warm body we got left
you know what im saying here
youre her savior is she the kid youre gonna save from the burning building
cmon you intimidate her cause youre a celebrity she sees me differently
so am i
im serious here
my point exactly
i dont have a girlfriend
what would your girlfriend think of that
yeah
you wanna talk to her alone
look - let me talk to her any leads i get theyre all yours just let me have a first crack at her
raw deal
shes fucked even if that story is true
something back home
why not
is that all there is
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her
what are you hiding why are you afraid
then i guess were doin this the right way arent we if we pull up to a burning building ill gladly let you go first
i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid
hey i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling freeze  at the bad guy whatd you dream about
of course
so am i alright ill go inside and you cover the back
im on duty
you thirsty
im on my way with eddie ludwigs rd and madison the suspects might be there already
leon - meet us at rd and madison hair salon ludwigs
better than one
two heads
ill call it tails
tell you what - ill flip you a coin if you win you can come with me if you dont win you dont come
this is ridiculous im not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over
ill let you know what happens
but what if it does you might need my help
this has nothing to do with your fire
mind if i ride along with you
you got any better ideas
you goin to the escort service
stay here
my folks are
youre polish
my parents are from poland i can help with the eastern european angle
this isnt homicide school
i can watch you eddie maybe ill learn something
there wasnt a fire therell be nothing for you to do
ill come with you
or czechoslovakia the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years these are very intense people and they take things personally
eastern europe like what romania hungary
maybe its a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe it could be to humiliate them just burning them up no proper funeral its like condemning them to hell
look im not even sure she has anything to do with this i saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead maybe she saw something maybe she was visiting somebody here who knows
what would you call her
who says shes a suspect
maybe you dont care about that either prettiest suspect ive had in awhile
hmmmm
pretty
the super said hed seen her before but she didnt live here
you were right they were both dead before the fire the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine thats usually an indicator of something personal
if you found me steppin on your crime scene - it might piss you off too what about the report
sure but i would like to ask you something you got a problem with me
did you get a report from the m e
good good commendable
i dont even watch tv
nah why should you
well just so you know i dont care about that stuff
well just so you know i gave you guys the credit
nah i musta missed it
watch the news

why dont you explain it bobby hey camello you mind punching a hole in the floor
no what is it
you know what that is right
no we dont mind you mind leon
hey thats great you guys got it all wrapped up but you dont mind if we go through the routine it gives us somethin to do
smarter than americans youre fed cry baby talk shows all day long not only will americans believe me theyll cry for me so detective eddie flemming would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette maybe you can propose to her now
you really think youll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit how fuckin stupid are you

now that you know him maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him
there was a woman - i think she wanted to talk to us she looked scared oh shit oh no
what
thats why he was so quiet he was testing us
what
he knew all along
you see eddies face when i gave him the timer wish i had a picture of it
but you knew that right
the smokell permeate your nostrils - burn em out let it run
dont blow your nose

dont stoop to his level
dont you get it he knew he was gonna get caught thats why he videotaped eddies murder - he thinks hes gonna get off
what are you gonna do
the clerk
capra thats not czech or russian who said he sounded russian
room was registered to a francis capra
that doesnt apply to me because im not a criminal im not a criminal i wasnt convicted
but doesnt the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes
were in negotiations thats correct
and isnt there a movie in the works about you
look im in here you call this a career move
permanently disrupted arent you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money hasnt this incident as you call it jump started your career as an artist
look im a victim here too i was a year away from getting my masters in art now ill never graduate my life has been permanently disrupted
you seem very savvy for a man whos been found mentally incompetent to stand trial
it was my finger that pulled the trigger but im not morally responsible my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of how could i know im not a doctor
so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people
yes my psychiatrist didnt insist that i stay on my medication
your doctor
this had nothing to do with shoes that didnt fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor
were trying to get there i hope we can
continued
im sorry dr smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
continued
how did they manage to do that without any communication
continued
well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
continued
shes wonderful
continued
im afraid ive only got a few minutes but id love to
continued
well how nice to see you again elena youre looking wonderful
space stattion  - lounge
roger
i think ill have to go out and burn them off
i guess not
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
i didnt do that frank i took particular care not to freeze them
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
its the last one
yes
hal
well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those other- wise were out of business
two more
two units in four days how many spares do we have
i dont know hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
no
youre kidding
well hals reported the ao-unit about to fail again
oh im fine im wide awake whats up
are you reasonably awake
good morning hows it going
anyway its just as well that we replace it better safe than sorry
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes i dont know what to make of it
well thats something
still all we have to do is ask hal
i guess it isnt
i suppose it isnt logically impossible
but not completely inconceivable
i know it would be almost inconceivable
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
not really though it is strange when you think about it it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training
thats true
just ask hal its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
how
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
yes i thought so
that seems very unlikely
i dont know all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told
oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard
no as a matter of fact i didnt
yes you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out
oh
i suppose so though of course theres a more sinister explanation
i suppose the idea was specialized training
no i never did either
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet im sure theyll straighten it out
well what do you think we ought to do about it
its possible
not really they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ- ent accounting offices
yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags- notification for the other three but not mine and apparently not yours either
yes
really
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
thats right well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags-
well i got the papers on my official up-grading to ags- two weeks before we left
yes
its about my salary cheques
whats up
well its nothing really important but its annoying
sure what is it
dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something
okay come on down
okay
right just a sec
hi frank coming in please
listen to me very carefully hal unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission
i am prepared to do that anyway
hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
im sorry dave but in accordance with sub-routine c quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it
hal im in command of this ship i order you to release the manual hibernation control
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest
i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest youve been involved in a very stressful situation
hal switch to manual hibernation control
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do i suggest you leave it to me
im goin to do this myself hal let me have the control please
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself theres no need for you to trouble
i dont really agree with you dave my on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
it doesnt have to be hal its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth let me have manual control please
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
the antenna has to be replaced
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months
i suppose youre pretty broken up about it
yes it is
too bad about frank isnt it
well thats a relief you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
yes it is hal
is your confidence in me fully restored
and dont you worry about it
well dont worry about it
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
naturally dave im not pleased that the ao-unit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history
okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is with the ao-units and with your test gear
hal is there anything bothering you anything that might account for this problem
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible im not capable of being wrong
yes i know that but i can assure you that they were about to fail
you probably also know that we found them okay
yes i know
you know that we checked the two ao-units that you reported in imminent failure condition
sure dave whats up
not now hal id like to talk to you about something
i understand hal well take care of it please let me have the hard copy
the unit is still operational dave but it will fail within seventy-two hours
my f p c shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
what is it hal
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem
hes got a point
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and why are we going
continued
still you really dont believe it do you
continued
well its silly but if you want to why dont you
coninued
well what is it
continued
did they have any explanation for this
continued
yes i remember you mentioning it i got mine about the same time
continued
goodbye daddy
bye bye now sweetheart
yes daddy
ill wish you a happy birthday now and ill see you soon all right darling
thank you daddy
okay sweetheart have a lovely birthday party tomorrow
three darling one two  three be sure to tell mommy i called
how many days until you come home
okay sweetheart well i have to go now tell mommy that i called
shes in the bathroom
where is mrs brown
mommys out to the hair- dresser
one two three can i speak to mommy
in three days darling i hope
when are you coming home
no im sorry darling i told you i wont be home for a few days
are you coming to my party
yes i know that sweetheart
im having a party tomorrow
im fine daddy when are you coming home
im at space station five darling how are you
ill bet its a fortune
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
well hows it going back there
thank you
oh thank you very much
thank you its been a great pleasure to meet all of you dr smyslov
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
well i hope that you and your wife can come to the i a c conference in june
no thank you and im afraid now i really must be going
are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink
well that does sound very odd
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
well where are all of you off to
hes fine but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days
how is gregor
oh thats such a delightful age
oh shes growing up very fast as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
and your charming little daughter
yes its coming along very well
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking
yes i think so just about then
fine
well shall we go through documentation
yes very pleasant
well did you have a pleaant flight
please it really doesnt matter
well thank you very much for being so understanding
im terribly sorry i was just on my way down to meet you i saw your ship dock and i knew i had plenty of time and i was on my way out of the office when suddenly the phone rang
how do you do mr miller
dr smyslov im not permitted to discuss this
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr floyd we should be given all the facts
quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius something apperently of an unknown origin is this in fact what has happened
certainly
dr floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
well im glad about that
fortunately they did
yes well i hope the crew got back safely
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i a s convention
i see
thats right
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days
yes well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
really
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean
yes as a matter of fact i am
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon
yes really thank you very much
are you quite sure
oh i really dont have time for a drink if its all right ill just sit for a minute and then ive got to be off
i dont think it has but id like to check that simpson whats the log on that
has it been exposed to any sun before now
well not really at first glance black would suggest something sun-powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device
any ideas about the colour
tomb shine survey-marker spare part take your choice
but you dont have any idea as to what it is
not really its completely inert no sound or energy sources have been detected the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it a laser drill
any clue as to what it is
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
yes it does the sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement
dr floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
no of course captain i can understand your concern
well fine thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking
yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have died already
i see well im sorry about that i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
well ill tell you why i ask you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her
i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
i see
well the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours and then were going to back empty
what do you mean
incidentally dr floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
thank you
oh no thank you the two girls have taken wonderful care of me im just fine
were scheduled to dock in about seven hours is there anything we can do for you
when do we arrive at clavius
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
oh marvellous its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days
all right hal well take care of it let me have the hard copy please
not really frank i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault
let me see the tracking alignment display
i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure
it looks like we have another bad a o unit my fpc shows another impending failure
yes hal whats up
opening pod bay doors
pod bay is decompressed all doors are secure you are free to open pod bay doors
hal check all airlock doors secure
roger
hal maintain normal e v a condition
i understand
hal im going out now to replace the a o unit
five by five frank
roger
hal have pod arms secure the component
thank you very much hal
thats true
there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets is that true
thats true
approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back is this true
thats true

hey jack how ya doin what took you so long to call man i been waitin  im at vromans up in the fillmore yeah vromans course you dont hang out here its for the brothers
no way
you stay with me
bullshit then im staying with the money
right if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping then youre all set
that was in style a couple years back man
yeah most cops are pretty dumb but since youre the one that landed in jail whats that make you
were getting too close  cates whats the matter you been takin dumb pills
class isnt somethin you buy punk look at you five hundred dollar suit and youre still a lowlife
no class
what you dont understand is i dont give a damn about how this thing looks
you know id be embarrassed if i let my wheels go the way youve done with this job
yeah it doesnt look like hes gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy
a long time agb luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain  that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row
if hes hoping that then hes dumber than i think he is which would be amazin cause i already think hes real dumb
maybe luther hopes ganzll give him a piece of your money
you got a very depressing view of life man you gotta smile once in awhile
im not in this cause its fun im not into hitting guys cause it makes me feel good either i do it cause it works-
doesnt it get tiring
if they dont tell me what i need to know
say do you always work people over like you did luther
that aint philosophy thats common sense
i let women get to me the quest for pussy is the meaning of life  i got my own personal philosophy about em keep women separate from guns money and business  women are for spending money they got nothing to do with helping you make it
i suppose youd never be like luther and let a woman get to you
oh yeah does bein in love make you stupid
im tellin you the mans in love he wants to be a hero for his girl
if i was his size and had ganz on my ass id just leave town
tryin to save his girl man hes in another world
youd think the guyd be smart enough to know he was being tailed
i had no choice some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue cadillac
didnt know you darker people went in for foreign jobs
jesus christ look at all the dust on my car why in the hell dont he take it to a car wash
jesus christ thats a disgrace the guy pulls a gun on a cop and hes out in  hours i tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door
musta got some primo bondsman
what
guess what luther just got in line
not really i figured ganz was put down for a long time and i knew luther would never job me on his own hes too chickenshit
you took a big chance leaving this here all this time
shit
i wasnt sure the money was still there until we saw luther you almost got your ass shot off for nothing once not twice jack
you son of a bitch you knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait i almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing
you just drove by it
for three years lets hope it wasnt a tow-away zone
thisll show you how smart i am i got it parked
youre a real case you know that jack
wheres the goddamn car
yeah right
get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends if ganz gets away with my money youre gonna be sorry we ever met
right partner
in the trunk of a car a lot better than under a mattress right
wheres the money
depends on how things work out i believe in the merit system so far you havent built up any points
you gonna let me keep any of it
not likely convict
we split -
you catch on real fast okay jack lets talk deal how much of my money you gonna let me keep
hes after your money
me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale its the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen i was sittin pretty livin in the high cotton then somebody fingered me for another job  some psycho whos out there capping people with some cops gun
just tell me about the money
jesus
half a million
how much
i been waiting a long time for some money
one things for sure jack thats how youll tell the story
they saved your ass convict
naw youd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time
yeah right you want to try again
who gives a goddamn what you think youre just a crook thats got a weekendpass  youre not even a name anymore just a spear- chucker with a goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues
maybe i dont like the way you ask
luther knew more than he told me and so do you now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about i gave you  hours to come up with something and the clocks runnin 
im impressed with you too jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night
you dont make me laugh you cant take care of shit youve been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt all youre good for is games so far what i got outta you is nothin
you wanna leave man let me take care of ganz all by myself
this sucks a maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it so instead of me being where i oughta be which is in bed giving my girl the high hard one im out here doing this shit roaming around with some overdressed charcoal-colored loser like you
wait a minute maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us how about it i been nearly three years in prison and
lets go
come on
must be billys girl
there
while youre at it you can give me the switchblade too
you made that move huh
some of us citizens are with you all the way officer

i dont know what youre talking about i just wanna see ganz nailed
you tell me what ganz busted out for hes after a lot more than just gettin out of jail and whatever it is youre part of it
what are you talkin about
ill tell you what happens if you lose you tell the truth for once
thats never been one of my problems
why anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably cant get it up anyway
if we come outta this joint with ganz phone number or a dead indian or anything else useful then you could turn the other way for half an hour while i get laid
i got two problems number one im not playin games number two you got nothin to bet with
hey you wanna bet
you need five years training to handle a joint like
i been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers all those clowns ever had going for em was a gun and a badge
bullshit attitude and experience get you through
but you can handle it all right huh real amazin how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats
if they kick my ass theyll sure as hell carve yours up
back you up now why would i wanna do that
this part of town theyll make us for heat the second we walk in just back me up like youve got a piece
its a long shot but billy used to tend bar here a few years back i heard him talk about it

luther aint the reliable type i dont want you shot yet cates  not before you been a help to me
your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me
just up the street the other side over there  now dont bother knockin on the door luther aint the kind of guy that looks for company
i may call you worse than that

it looks like you bought it off one of the brothers
yeah
shit im already sorry
get this we aint partners we aint brothers we aint friends im puttin you down and keepin you down until ganz is locked up or dead and if ganz gets away youre gonna be sorry we ever met
no way to start a partnership
you just dont get it do your reggie there isnt any deal i own your ass
hey no way take off the bracelets or no deal
you got a girl shit the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me
i dont need to hear your jive i already got that department taken care of
listen it may be a little out of date you know i got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies
were supposed to be after a killer not a string of hookers
what are you talkin about this suits mine it cost 
this prison gives out  suits
ill think about it
its the only way youre gonna get ganz
bullshit
i got a lot to protect
whats the big deal about you bein on the street
i can help you man but you gotta get me out i got to be on the street get me outta here
youre crazy
i can deliver ganz but you gotta get me outta here first
yeah
didnt work out that way he busted out with a big indian they capped two guards on a road gang nice meeting you reggie

im taking my prisoner back to jail
where the christ do you think youre going
just cause you say it with conviction dont mean shit to me how you gonna take to a pink slip huh
hes got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop ive worked with
too bad it wouldve covered your ass now youre in the shit and sos the department in case you havent noticed this wasnt our finest hour i told you everyone was watchin on this one maybe you better start thinkin about writin tickets off a three wheel bike
i didnt have the time
dont duck the bullet cates why didnt you call in for backup instead of makin a grandstand play
right i screwed up i fucked up i messed up anybody could have done better especially you i bet youre real good at hitting targets through crowds
what a screw-up
you couldnt get to him
the indian i was about  yards away
which one pulled the trigger
they ran as fast as they could caught a train
how did they get away
i lost them thats what happened
what the bell happened
ill keep it in mind
try not to get your ass shot to pieces we got enough dead cops on this one
yeah
jack
you really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude he starts to go
okay youre not a team player you gotta do things your own way fine nail this guy and make us all look good but you better watch your ass if you screw up i can promise you youre goin down
being a hot dogs worked pretty well for me so far besides i got a lead
you might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one jack
yeah it bothers me when cops get hurt while im makin a play i dont like it
anthing botherin you besides losin your gun
yeah
jack come on there is an official department policy about cop killings cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian in other words we cant seen like were in the revenge business i know we all know the truths a little different
hey the bastards got my gun i want it back
yeah i read the report
i want to be left alone on this one algren was killed with my gun
i guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible
are you gonna tell me about police procedure do me a favor dont give me a bunch of crap
somebody steals your gun youre supposed to file a report
the truth hurts doesnt it buddy
but thats what you say about all of us all the tine  were always the ones fucking up when you tell it

howd they take it back at headquarters
lets go reggie
what do i know im just a bartender
whaddya think
oh yeah well look where you came when you were down and out
hey come on shrink times over they wouldnt go see some old girlfriend
when a guy hurts you then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees who knows he might just be irrestible
so what
it might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions i was in bed with a girlfriend watching tv last week jack and one thing we know about me is i happen not to be a lesbian  now if this indians girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him it could just be shes still vulnerable to him
come on they were a little old for a slumber party
what makes you think they were lesbians or as you so quaintly put it dykes
jack its all over the papers hes an obvious type but this indian
how do you know
ganz is going to be hard to track just a pure schizo  wires all crossed totally without any pattern kill anybody the indian himself anybody
nothing no sign of ganz no sign of the indian airports clean train station bus station docks shit
ive been better dead end no ganz no indian
you real down
we and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours
i can see that pardon me for saying so but you look like shit what happened

elaine look im in the middle of sone stuff right now im not gonna have time to come by i dont know when i can get there
just one some lady called said shes a little hot-headed sometimes but she still wants her occasional roommate shed like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight if its humanly possible
i get that the job first everything else especially me second i get it i dont like it
thats right im not like you im not gonna sit on my ass wondering whats right and whats wrong theres a psycho out there killing people with my gun and im gonna get him because its my job and if you dont get that
here it comes again  the sacred job
i didnt get burned two cops did listen ill tell you about personnel responsibility i like to get the job done right and if i dont get my job done right im for shit
look jack if you make everything your personal responsibility youll turn into a bad cop its not a practical way to function
bullshit ill tell you about bullshit my guns a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it it isnt my macho bullshit thats killing people my gun is 
look spare me the macho bullshit about your gun
sure okay fine no problem see theres this kid in jail  first thing i got to do is go up and see what he knows 
jack are you okay
yeah guess it must have been a slow news day
you made the front page
yeah one of my favorites
great place for lunch
guess people ought to know who i am
i think you forgot this hands him his wallet and badge
thanks for the coffee
yeah for some reason im sure
you sure you want me to
call me later
thats the way i see it too
you know something jack you really are hopeless
i wish youd stop trying to make me mad so i wont care for you i wish youd give me a little more of a chance
what do you want to know what difference does it make im the guy in your bed the last three months i make you feel good you make me feel good what the hell else do you want from a guy
when you start with that attitude its like i dont know who you are
maybe you dont know what the hell youre talking about
maybe that makes a nice excuse
maybe i got a fairly crummy day ahead
thats a fairly crummy way to start a morning
maybe i would if i knew when you were coming back
maybe you ought to buy me one
what makes you think i have any clean shirts at my place
you know if you let me come over to your place once in a while you could put on a clean shirt in the morning
i think youre ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear you pull down four bills a week which is damn good and you mix the best pina coladas ive ever had i think that if you need bigger and better things  then go for em
tell me--im dyin to hear it
hey you know what i really think
if this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems ill take brutal indifference
i do think all psychotherapy is bullshit but just because i think its bullshit doesnt mean i dont know something about it
arent you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit
positive self-image problem all over again  you are who you decide you are unless youre the type that lets assholes decide for you
then i sit back and i think i mean whos to say im not a dumb bitch i work in a bar right i cant read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place you are what you do
i guess he got the message
irrigated his face with the shot of j and b id just poured him then i tried to deck the sucker

a guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today
whats wrong with that
im all wet
thats the way i see it too
youre hopeless

this is a  magnum the most powerful handgun in the world you gotta ask yourself just one question are you feelin lucky
i dont think your guns loaded
i dont answer questions i ask em
what am i wanted for

thats no bull

the case was stolen
san agamat chay bet envolet
the case with the stones where is it
napoleon small
whatre you laughing about
at your service
corn-i-lius
appipulai leeloo minai
i know
you are a monster zorg
let me reassure you father i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last  years
destroying a glass is one thing killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another
father by creating a little destruction i am in fact encouraging life so in reality you and i are in the same business
they are robots
look at all these little things so busy all of a sudden notice how each one is useful what a lovely ballet so full of form and color so full of life
follow me life which you so nobly serve comes from destruction look at this empty glass
no thank you
would you like a drink
ah father you are so wrong let me explain
im a priest im here to serve life all you want to do is destroy it
why whats wrong with me
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you
personally they are of no interest to me id rather sell weapons but i have a customer so tell me
why on earth do the stones interest you
im glad you got your memory back father because youre going to need it where are the stones
i remember you now the so called art dealer
zorg jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg nice to see you again
im fucked
were saved
thats what im saying
and you dont know how they open is that what you are saying
yes of course but the stones are shut they have to be open for it to work
theres no light you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light
theoretically yes the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there but i dont have the reference book ive never seen the stones work
dont tell me you dont know how all this works
uh have you tried the divas suite
when is she not in trouble
leeloos in trouble
yeah i know to save the world but right now all i want to do is save leeloo
youre probably very angry with me and i quite understand but i want you to know im fighting for a noble cause
trying to save your ass so you can save the world
what are you doing
father i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends so thanks for the offer but no thanks
of course
good luck
we have to save the world
what kind of mission
were not going on vacation were on a mission
is that the usual way priests go on vacation
im sorry to have to resort to such methods but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston
thats what i thought
it means never without my permission
excuse me just one thing she said something to me a while ago and i dont really get it akta gamat
i know i was there when she arrived
shes fine really dont you worry just needs some rest shes had a very long trip
i might call to check up on her you know to see if shes better
yes thats fine thank you very much a thousand times over
dallas korben dallas
thank you so much for your help mr
shes an exception
they all like this in your family father
uh yes were cousins distant cousins
so you do know her
theres not a moment to lose wake her up but be gentle about it this woman is mankinds most precious possession she is perfect
you noticed
hes a she
the girl
i brought the girl remember
who are you
she dropped in on me holding this
thats me but i dont know who she is where did you find her
shes not my bride shes my fare shes looking for this vito cornelius according to the phone guide he lives here
weddings are one floor down congratulations
excuse me im looking for a priest
this is government business now you ought to go home and get some rest father
what are we going to do
thank you mr president
did you see that thing swallow our battleship like a gum drop you cant even tell me what it is i ask you for options you give me bullshit give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards
white turns to black light to dark life to death for all eternity
but what happens if instead of this ultimate warrior it is evil who stands here
yes thank god
is there anything that can stop it
and then it will be too late the goal of evil is to wipe out life all forms of life for all eternity life upsets it
and then
we have forty-eight hours the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions
thats exactly what we are going to try and do protect the lives of some  billion of our fellow citizens general you may fire when ready
time is of no importance mr president only life is important
your theory is interesting father but i dont think we have time to go into it right now
one more reason to shoot first eh
imagine for a moment that this thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be because it is the antithesis of all we are because it is evil total evil
later david later theres not a minute to lose
youre all safe thanks be to god
its all my fault im the servant its my mission here
on the plane with mr dallas the real one
wheres leeloo
good work my son now all we need is a way to get there
i got it everything here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel
perfect
they really made her
i didnt know your size
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago said he was an art dealer  asking all these questions about the sacred stones at the time i didnt think anything of it what was his name im so bad with names
yes of course
uh father i know shes been through a lot but the sacred stones we dont have much time
learning our history the last  years that she missed shes been out of circulation a while you know
whats she doing
absolutely sure theres the triple suns on her gloves
father you sure shes the supreme being
the supreme being the fifth element is here in our parish its a miracle
father will you please explain whats going on
i cant wear these clothes this calls for dignity i have to dress the part
what is
its a miracle
they are with me
im sorry but the stones
i would like to have died in peace
listen the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her  i never saw her again
i dont have time i need to know
i i dont know we hardly know each other it takes time
do you love her
ill help her i promise but i think you should tell me where the stones are
she was taught to love the life of others but not her own you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live
so cornelius was telling the truth
yes and more than that you must give her the stones shes the only one who knows how to use them
leeloo is shes
the fifth element the supreme being your wife

youre a good man she was right to have chosen you
leeloo

an elephant couldnt crack it
this thing solid

this is the crucial phase the reconstruction of pigment cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react to protect themselves that means growing skin clever eh
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector the cell is for lack of a better word perfect
is there any danger some kind of virus
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours there are simply more of them tightly packed his knowledge is probably limitless
yes i cant wait to meet him
sounds like a freak of nature to me
this cell is like a huge library it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside almost like it was engineered
talk english doc
its not that easy weve never encountered anything like it before you see normal human beings have  dna memo groums which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself this one has 
have you identified it
actually only one cell survived
this is all that survived
how much time is left
they just landed in the desert
dont worry sir i have the perfect one
i want your best man on this

put the gun down take the handcuffs handcuff yourself to the bed
is that him
its good what youre doing
youre gonna be seeing a lot of me youre sure you dont mind
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after
any good
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance we try to keep the children and adults separate no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall
well thats all i can do sorry
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them
i can give you my card if your clients want to call me
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear
im not so sure about this
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run molestation whatever besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal
why dont they come to me
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
we do
i figured you share information
why not go to the n c i c or n c m e c
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off  which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can i d this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright
absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out
there are reasons for the way we do things here
what id like very simply is access to your archive and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private citizens
alright tom
call me tom
what can i do for you mr welles
what do you want you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby 
thats right you just stood there and watched because you felt like it almost makes you worse
i never killed anyone
easy enough for you
do it put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore you think its so easy
dont think i wont
do it
i fucking dont know what do you think we werent burying treasure we didnt pace it out so we could come back and get it we dug a hole and we put her in it your guess is as good as mine
where show me where
i dont know  out there somewhere
show me where you buried her
you got absolute zero
stop talking
you cant go to the cops all you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing
where do you think youre taking this huh gonna be a big hero avenge that little girls death gonna make everything right with the world how you gonna do that 
keep moving
show me
took it out the bathroom window buried it in the woods
what did you do with her body
there wasnt nobody around this place was a shit-hole i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work
nobody saw you bring her in
what do you want to know you saw it you saw the loop
tell me what happened
made me sick but what did i care what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that it was just something i was doing for money
you enjoy it
i dont know i felt like it i never saw anyone get done before
because were going there
why
show me where you did it on the map exactly where you did it
fuck you then you want to know i talked her up told her how beautiful she was told her she was gonna be a star i told her i was gonna get her a screen test and while im doing that i got her a soda and dropped a mickey when it was dark enough i rang dino and told him it was go time i put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it thats what happened shes dead shes been dead a long fucking time nobody fucking cares
i want to know i want to know exactly what you did to her
what the fuck do you want from me
what did you do knock her out shoot her up 
something like that
so you brought dino in and he brought machine and one day a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models and she never walked out
it was a lot of fucking money
thats all thirty each thats all it took for you to murder her
thirty thousand each that fucking cocksucker
how much did he pay you
yeah
told him you could get him a snuff film
yeah the fucking lawyer
okay well come back to that so six years ago a guy contacts you through the classifieds over the phone however he does it its longdale looking for a snuff film and you entrepreneur that you are tell him you can hook him up
what the fuck am i gonna protect that freak for he was dinos boy not mine he shows up with his mask on leaves with his mask on nobody knows
i will never get tired of hurting you eddie so you might want to change your attitude
i told you i dont know
i want his name
i dont know
who is machine
what do you want
starting to recognize a pattern
fuck you
dont ask questions
howd you find me here
dont bore me with that bullshit
im gonna kill you
one million dollars dino how much did he tell you he had
whats he talking about
you killed that girl and you put it on film you and your pals youre fucked you fucked up real good
what the fuck are you 
you murdered that girl eddie six years ago
who is this
i know what you did
what
i know what you did
yeah whos this
eddie
celebrity films
fuck you
get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head till then fuck you
look you cocksucker
the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap youre peddling eddie where do you get this stuff
maybe theres something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place ever think of that
i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return it
you know how my tapes sell people eat this stuff up
look at him you think he played it square how much did he give you how much did he keep for himself
hes lying
go ahead shoot me then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
give me the film
youll get it when we get there
give me the film
fuck you
you almost went over your limit
because he could he did it because he could what other reason were you looking for
enlighten me
isnt it incredibly obvious
why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered
a man like mr christian a great man all his money all his power a man who attained everything there was to attain
im asking
youre asking me why
just tell me tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared what kind of degenerate pervert was he really what the fuck did he want with a snuff film
youre making me very angry
did it get him off huh watching them cut her up tell me because i really want to understand did he jerk off to it you watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched 
shut your mouth and drive
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
shut up
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right wanted them to find you one well they didnt find you one longdale they went out and made you one
mary anne mathews that was her name her mom remembers her
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone if you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago a girl no one even remembers
except youre willing commit murder with them
theyre no friends of mine
followed me must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
never mind how i found you
thats why you got scared when mrs christian hired me you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe howd you find me
i was well compensated
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly
so he sent you gave you the money his errand-boy and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film thats the beauty of lawyer client privilege
wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
you were the middleman am i right old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
thats right
you are a private investigator
of what sort
as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
im listening
yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted you
its not my money the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought lets not make a big deal out of this okay go be a race car driver go run for president whatever
look thats awful generous and everything
its money people use it to purchase goods and services
whats this
nope
still dont want to tell me what youre doing
im trying to figure that out myself i have to see machine without his mask
whats next
devil frightened me as much as it excited me but id be hard pressed to choose a favorite
i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil
what kind of junior p i would i be if i didnt go with you
you dont need to be here
nobody knows his name thats his thing he always wears a mask you never see his face he calls himself machine thats what they call him machine
who is he his name
i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players
who is he
who is this in the mask who is he
wha 
its cheap and people know to mind their own business what have you got for me
oh come on man what are we doing in this flea bag
great
its their presidential suite
you didnt say it was gonna be this luxurious
see ya
consider it meanwhile dig up whatever dino velvet films you can get receipts ill call back
you want me to come out there and play private eye
take a vacation ill pay you four hundred a day plus expenses
im a working stiff pops
well im in new york now what do you say to flying out and giving me a hand
he cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies photographs newsreel footage subliminal images thinks hes making art
alright i get the picture
nothing illegal its always borderline like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a
out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look hell also do commissions for enough money
where does he sell it
youre learning
specialty product
his stuff comes out of new york bondage and fetish videos gothic hardcore definitely not for the squeamish
a weirdo making s m films whod have thought it
dino velvet yeah hes like the john luc godard of s m flicks supposed to be a real weirdo
good question
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this
a daughter
i see a ring on your finger you have any kids
what about me
you cant sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb so what am i gonna go off and be a race car driver go to harvard run for president what about you pops
youre telling me it doesnt get to you
yeah im a real genius what choices have i got fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it i work a job it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
im not mixed up in anything hayseed what are you talking about
i dont mean any offense but what are you doing mixed up in all this
i dont know where are yours
where are your parents
twenty-five
how old are you
first of all basement sales like tonight arent gonna last much longer its too risky one and two everythings going on the internet anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants its heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes no one knows where it comes from thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth those are zombies hardcore junkies their hands are permanently pruned they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister other than that all i know about is the mail classified ads in the paper with hidden codes secret couriers credit card orders to dummy corporations interstate wire transfers revolving p o boxes but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows thats the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
what other ways are there to get illegal films who do you see
i heard you asking that guy wasnt yanking you around theres no such thing
snuff films
theres two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she- males hemaphrodites its beyond hardcore but legal this is the kind of hardcore where one guys going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love now with some of the s m and bondage films they straddle the line how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not step over that line youre into kiddie porn rape films but there arent many ive never seen one
child pornography
what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend were talking about stuff where people get hurt specialty product
interesting theory
youve got penthouse playboy hustler etc nobody even considers them pornography anymore then theres mainstream hardcore triple x the difference is penetration thats hardcore that whole industrys up in the valley writers directors porn stars theyre celebrities or they think they are they pump out  videos a week a week theyve even got a porno academy awards america loves pornography anybody tells you they never use pornography theyre lying somebodys buying those videos somebodys out there spending  million dollars a year on phone sex know what else its only gonna get worse more and more youll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because thats evolution desensitization oh my god elvis presleys wiggling his hips how offensive nowadays mtvs showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out know what i mean for the porn-addict big tits arent big enough after a while they have to be the biggest tits ever some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally soon playboy is gonna be penthouse penthousell be hustler hustlerll be hardcore and hardcore filmsll be medical films peoplell be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds theres nowhere else for it to go

mrs christian tom welles here
hello
youre one hell of a detective mrs christian
you told me to look so i looked
send it to me through the post office like we arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself
okay
for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
do you think the film could have cost that much
im here
hello 
to the penny exactly one million dollars in cash
youre joking
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
okay i follow you so far
one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
the checks were for odd amounts
im not positive this means anything
my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
okay
i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her
nothing remotely like this
youve found missing persons before
i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
it wont work like that
no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first
you dont have any other choice
i told you i cant not yet
you you need to go to the police
of course but im certain its nothing to worry about
will you watch it and see for yourself
im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it
im telling you its not that
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play
no
please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects
mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you
i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could
im afraid i dont
its a film of a girl being murdered
cash stock certificates and this
do you want to tell me what you found
there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize
you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is
just curious
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason
do you carry a gun mr welles
we were married forty-five years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply
he succeeded
mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary
pittsburgh
ill do whatever i can to help
his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma
my condolences
as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now
you are highly recommended praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality
ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places
hes a lawyer please sit here
hes odd
thank you
have a pleasant evening will you have tea mister welles
apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
uh huh pleasure
i try to be
mister welles youre very prompt
they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time
why why are you doing this to me 
they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her
no no no
he raped her and and and he murdered her he cut her up with knifes
no
they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her
who are you
someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her
who is this 
mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead
what 
she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress
what are you talking about 
i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true
i remember you just left
mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter
hello 
what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her  or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know
its been six years
i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her
yes
you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry
youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know
my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me
will you let me look
how how can you say that to me
if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
no you dont have any reason to think that
it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something
i dont know i think so
do you think the police did a good job
there wasnt one the police looked
its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye
what
ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though
you should be
no
are you religious
were all like that
doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church
okay
i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow
of course
people remember me from the news can you drive me back now
no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts
i had to ask i apologize
you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
i didnt mean to
there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse
it got to be too much for him
why do you think he did it
we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend
september th  about a year after mary disappeared
yes
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide
i dont know
what was she running from
she didnt seem herself for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it one night we went to bed the next morning she was gone she took some clothes
she just seemed depressed 
no
so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hair-lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv
thats exactly what i am
they hired you youre like a private detective
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope
well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair born april   missing june th  a runaway thats how shes listed is this information correct 
no
right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me he didnt call
neil neil cole
