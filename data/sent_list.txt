he 's the devil 's child .
we'll all go crazy .
we should have seen land .
we left three weeks ago , alonso .
can't be that near .
can't be that far , i say .
you say asia can be found by sailing west ?
yes , your eminence .
the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks .
unfortunately , don colon , that is precisely where our opinions differ .
i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible .
your life , and that of others !
your life , and that of others !
if they agree to follow me , yes .
even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold .
is that all that interests you ?
gold ?
no .
don't you realize your words could be considered heretical ?
blind faith is what i consider heresy !
asia can be found to the west -- and i will prove it .

i find that hard to believe .
she said yes .
thank god .
i'm not asking you to swear to anything .
i don't want you to wait for me .

i remind you , senor colon , that you are in no position to bargain with me .
i'm not bargaining !
i'm not bargaining !
then you are too ambitious .

if you won't accept our proposal , we'll simply find someone who will .
and .
forgive me , don colon .
you should contact my administration .
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
don bobadilla is already a judge , my dear don cristobal .
